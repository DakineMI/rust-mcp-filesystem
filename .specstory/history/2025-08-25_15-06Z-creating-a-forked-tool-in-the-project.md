# Creating a forked tool in the project (2025-08-25 15:06Z)

_**User**_

fork this repo

---

_**Assistant**_

The repository `rust-mcp-filesystem` is being forked to your GitHub account (`DakineMI`). Once the fork is complete, you can access and work with your own copy of the repository. Let me know if you need help with cloning, setting up remotes, or making changes to your fork.

---

_**User**_

Update the remotes

---

_**Assistant**_

The remotes have been updated:
- `origin` now points to your fork (`DakineMI/rust-mcp-filesystem`)
- `upstream` points to the original repository (`rust-mcp-stack/rust-mcp-filesystem`)

You are ready to push changes to your fork and pull updates from the original repo. Let me know if you need help with anything else.

---

_**User**_

do not push upstream

---

_**Assistant**_

Understood. With your current remote setup, any changes you push using `git push origin` will only go to your fork (`origin`), not the upstream/original repository. As long as you avoid using `git push upstream`, your changes will not affect the upstream repository.

Let me know if you need help with branching, pushing, or making pull requests from your fork.

---

_**User**_

Update the remotes, do not push upstream

---

_**Assistant**_

The remotes are now configured so that you cannot push to the upstream repository. Only your fork (`origin`) can be pushed to, while `upstream` is fetch-only.

You are safe from accidentally pushing changes to the original repository. Let me know if you need further assistance.
